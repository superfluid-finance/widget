## Events Handling

Blockchain Events play a crucial role in understanding the real-time behavior of streams. The primary event to watch for is the `flowUpdated` event. You can retrieve these events from our [subgraph](https://console.superfluid.finance/subgraph) or query them directly on-chain.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  flowUpdatedEvents(where: {receiver: "MY_ADDRESS"}) {
    sender
    token
    flowRate
    timestamp
  }
}
```

<Callout> Use our [console playground](https://console.superfluid.finance/subgraph) to find the right queries for you. Check out our [protocol docs](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/subgraph) for links to all of our Subgraph APIs  </Callout>
