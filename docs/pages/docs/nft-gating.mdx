# NFT Gating

Gate your content using our special NFTs ! Use the widget builder to deploy your unique NFT, allowing you to effectively gate your products. Here's how it works:

1. A user subscribes to your product.
2. Upon subscription, an NFT token is assigned to them, serving as a proof of subscription.
3. If a user's subscription ends or is terminated, their ERC721 balance drops to zero, meaning they no longer possess the NFT indicating their subscription.

The NFT acts as a dynamic pass, only valid during the user's subscription period. Once the subscription ceases, so does the NFT's validity.

## Deploying Your NFT for Gating Content

In order to deploy your NFT collection along with your widget, follow these steps when creating your widget at the [Widget Builder](https://checkout-builder.superfluid.finance/builder):

</div>

- **NFT Symbol**: Provide a unique symbol for your NFT.
