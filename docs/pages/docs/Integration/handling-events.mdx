## Events Handling

Events play a crucial role in understanding the real-time behavior of streams. The primary event to watch for is the `flowUpdated` event. You can retrieve these events from our subgraph or query them directly on-chain.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  flowUpdatedEvents(where: {receiver: "MY_ADDRESS"}) {
    sender
    token
    flowRate
    timestamp
  }
}
```
