## Prerequisites

Before you begin with the Superfluid Web3 Subscription Widget, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

### Knowledge

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: A foundational understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript is necessary for successful integration and troubleshooting.
- **Blockchain Development**: Familiarity with the basics of blockchain development will be beneficial, given the widget's blockchain nature.

### Setup

1. **Initialize a Next.js Project**:
   If you haven't already, create a new Next.js application using the command below:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app your-app-name
   ```

2. **Install Wagmi**:
   Wagmi is a pivotal component for this integration. You can install it using one of the following package managers:

   <Tabs items={["npm", "Yarn"]}>
     <Tabs.Tab>```bash npm install wagmi --save ```</Tabs.Tab>
     <Tabs.Tab>```bash yarn add wagmi ```</Tabs.Tab>
   </Tabs>

<Callout type="warning">
  Ensure you have both Node.js and a package manager (npm or Yarn) installed on
  your system before proceeding.
</Callout>

With these prerequisites in place, you're set to proceed with building and integrating your widget.

## Step 1: Building Your Widget

## Step 2: Integrating Widget into Your Website

Superfluid provides an easy-to-use widget that can be swiftly integrated into your website or application. Let's explore the two primary methods for this integration.

### Option 1 (Easy): Embedding the Widget Using a Link

This is the quickest way to get started. You can redirect users to the widget via a simple link. Add this to your application's codebase and you are good to go:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other components */}
      <a href="https://superfluid.link/path_to_widget">
        Subscribe
      </a>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Callout> üöÄ Using the link method ensures you can get started with Superfluid without diving deep into your app's structure. It's fast, efficient, and user-friendly. </Callout>

### Option 2 (Complex): In-App Integration using NPM Package

If you want a more integrated experience where the Superfluid widget resides within your application's ecosystem rather than redirecting users externally, Superfluid offers a dedicated npm package for this purpose.

1. **Installation**: Install the npm package to your project.
    
    ```bash
    npm install @superfluid-finance/widget
    ```
    
2. **Integrate in Your App**: Now, you can import the widget into your application. We won't dive deep into the details here, but you can refer to the detailed [Superfluid Widget Integration Guide](www.superfluid.finance).
    

## Step 3: Verifying Active Streams
(***This Step is still WIP***)


To ensure that users have an active stream and are contributing the necessary amount to access your blog content, you can leverage `wagmi` to make a call to the `getFlow` function on the Superfluid smart contract. This function will provide you with the flow rate of a specific user. Based on this rate, you can then decide to grant or deny access to your content.


1. **Invoke the `getFlow` Function**: Use `wagmi` to call the `getFlow` function.
    
    ```javascript
    const userFlowRate = wagmi.getFlow(addressOfUser);
    ```
    
2. **Check the Flow Rate**: Compare the user's flow rate against the required rate to access the content.
    
    ```javascript
    const requiredFlowRate = 1000; // Example value
    
    if (userFlowRate >= requiredFlowRate) {
      // Grant access to the blog content
    } else {
      // Deny access or prompt the user to increase their flow rate
    }
    ```
    

<Callout> üõ°Ô∏è Always ensure that you're verifying streams in a secure manner to prevent unauthorized access to premium content. `wagmi` and Superfluid provide the tools, but always employ best practices in your implementation. </Callout>
