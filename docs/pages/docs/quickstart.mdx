## Prerequisites

Before you begin with the Superfluid Web3 Subscription Widget, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

### Knowledge

- **JavaScript**: A foundational understanding of JavaScript is necessary for successful integration and troubleshooting.
  
- **Blockchain Development**: Familiarity with the basics of blockchain development will be beneficial, given the widget's blockchain nature.

### Setup

1. **Initialize a Next.js Project**: 
   If you haven't already, create a new Next.js application using the command below:
   
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app your-app-name
   ```

2. **Install Wagmi**: 
   Wagmi is a pivotal component for this integration. You can install it using one of the following package managers:

   <Tabs items={['npm', 'Yarn']}>
      <Tabs.Tab>
      ```bash
      npm install wagmi --save
      ```
      </Tabs.Tab>
      <Tabs.Tab>
      ```bash
      yarn add wagmi
      ```
      </Tabs.Tab>
   </Tabs>
